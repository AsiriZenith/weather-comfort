# Goals & Background

## Goal
To build a **secure, responsive web application** that retrieves live weather data for a predefined list of cities, computes a **custom Comfort Index (0–100)** on the backend, and presents **ranked comfort insights** to authenticated users.

## Background
This project demonstrates:
- External API integration
- Server-side data processing
- Custom metric design
- Caching strategies
- Secure authentication & authorization
- Responsive UI development

The Comfort Index is intentionally **custom-designed** to demonstrate analytical reasoning rather than relying on predefined formulas.
