gate: PASS
status_reason: "All acceptance criteria met with comprehensive test coverage. Implementation follows best practices with proper error handling, cache expiration, and architecture compliance. Decision not to cache Comfort Index separately is well-reasoned."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns - caching is internal, no sensitive data exposure. Cache keys are predictable but acceptable for this use case."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "5-minute cache expiration reduces API calls significantly. IMemoryCache is efficient for expected city count (10+ cities). Cache hit/miss logging is minimal overhead."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling - cache failures don't break service functionality, gracefully falls back to API calls. Cache expiration handled automatically by IMemoryCache."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code structure, well-organized caching logic integrated into WeatherService. Cache key generation is centralized. Decision not to cache Comfort Index is well-documented."
